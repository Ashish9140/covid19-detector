                                        accurate and immediate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) detection to aid
                                        treatment and prevent the spread of the virus. Compared to other diagnosis
                                        methodologies, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is an advantageous tool since it is
                                        fast, low-cost, and easily accessible. Thus, CXR has a great potential not only
                                        to help diagnose COVID-19 but also to track the progression of the disease.
                                        Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning techniques for COVID-19
                                        diagnosis. However, they have used very limited CXR image repositories for
                                        evaluation with a small number, a few hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover,
                                        these methods can neither localize nor grade the severity of COVID-19 infection.
                                        For this purpose, recent studies proposed to explore the activation maps of deep
                                        networks. However, they remain inaccurate for localizing the actual infestation
                                        making them unreliable for clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for
                                        the joint localization, severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR
                                        images by generating the so-called infection maps that can accurately localize
                                        and grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. To accomplish this, we have
                                        compiled the largest COVID-19 dataset up to date with 2951 COVID-19 CXR images,
                                        where the annotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs
                                        by a novel collaborative expert human-machine approach. Furthermore, we publicly
                                        release the first CXR dataset with the ground-truth segmentation masks of the
                                        COVID-19 infected regions. A detailed set of experiments show that
                                        state-of-the-art segmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19 infection
                                        with an F1-score of 85.81%, that is significantly superior to the activation
                                        maps created by the previous methods. Finally, the proposed approach achieved a
                                        COVID-19 detection performance with 98.37% sensitivity and 99.16% specificity.

                                        caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any

                                        time, effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools
                                        practitioners currently use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse
                                        Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT),
                                        which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray
                                        imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for
                                        Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel approach for Covid-19
                                        recognition from chest X-ray images. Despite the importance of the problem,
                                        recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the
                                        limited datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques
                                        can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks
                                        when trained properly over large datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial
                                        obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as
                                        representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation)
                                        might provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they
                                        generally fall short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning
                                        methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network
                                        (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep
                                        Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query
                                        sample to ideally sparse representation coefficient' support, which is critical

                                    <div class="accordion-body">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a
                                        global health concern after its first known detection in December 2019. As a
                                        result, accurate and reliable advance warning system for the early diagnosis of
                                        COVID-19 has now become a priority. The detection of COVID-19 in early stages is
                                        not a straightforward task from chest X-ray images according to expert medical
                                        doctors because the traces of the infection are visible only when the disease
                                        has progressed to a moderate or severe stage. In this study, our first aim is to
                                        evaluate the ability of recent state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques for
                                        the early detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Both compact
                                        classifiers and deep learning approaches are considered in this study.
                                        Furthermore, we propose a recent compact classifier, Convolutional Support
                                        Estimator Network (CSEN) approach for this purpose since it is well-suited for a
                                        scarce-data classification task. Finally, this study introduces a new benchmark
                                        dataset called Early-Covid19 Detector, which consists of 175 early-stage
                                        COVID-19
                                        Pneumonia samples (very limited or no infection signs) labelled by the medical
                                        doctors and 1579 samples for control (normal) class. A detailed set of
                                        experiments shows that the CSEN achieves the top (over 98.5%) sensitivity with
                                        over 96% specificity. Moreover, transfer learning over the deep CheXNet
                                        fine-tuned with the augmented data produces the leading performance among other
                                        deep networks with 97.14% sensitivity and 99.49% specificity.
